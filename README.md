## What is the United Senate ?
The United Senate is a decentralized platform (dApp) for running a society without the need for money. Essentially, it is an access based economy that gives people the opportunity to learn, train and perform the necessary tasks to enable their community to function - they do this by joining a Senate.

Each Senate provides everyone 24/7 public visibility of the quantity, consumption and distribution of community resources by leveraging blockchain technology. 

The United Senate must, in union, provide and manage the distribution of resources sustainably to every person in the community. Those enrolled within a Senate receive greater access to resources than those who do not.

## How does it work?

First, the community to organise it's duties into a series of Senates. An example would be that each of these would have their own Senate.
 
+ Agriculture
+ Transport & Logistics
+ Arts + Sport
+ Medical & Wellbeing
+ Judicial 
+ others ...

The United Senate is a union of smaller senates working in harmony to execute the will of the citizens.

This works by citizens issuing tickets for the tasks and issues which matter to their community to a central project management dashboard. Citizens then upvote or downvote the tickets which matter most to them. Products in the market also work this way, the products that will enter the market will be those products with the highest upvotes (like Kickstarter).

Each issue is categorised and sent to be evaluated and actioned by a specific Senate.
